# Crop Type Classification with VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/monica-carlotti/Machine-Learning)

## Overview
This repository contains code for a deep learning model designed to classify three crop types: maize, wheat, and rice. The model utilizes the VGG16 architecture and is trained on a dataset sourced from web scraping. The primary goal is to provide accurate crop classification, contributing to advancements in precision agriculture.
